1. Make sure your linux has installed the 'nmap', if not, install it by using:
	sudo yum install nmap

2. Check your computer's ip by using:
	ifconfig -a

3. Use nmap to check all computers's ip by using:
		nmap -sP xxx.xx.xx.0/24
	here:
		after step 2,
		if your compters's inet addr is
			 172.19.21.140
	    	then " -sP xxx.xx.xx.0/24 " should be like 
			nmap -sP 172.19.21.0/24
