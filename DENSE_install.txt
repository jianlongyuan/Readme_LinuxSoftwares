1. Download sources

	1.1 Download FFTW  (e.g. fftw-3.3.5.tar ) from
        http://www.fftw.org/download.html
	
	1.2 Download Linux's Intel parallel software(e.g. parallel_studio_xe_2016.tgz) from
        https://software.intel.com/zh-cn/qualify-for-free-software/student
			Tips: This software contains Fotran and c compiler. And it's free for student,
				but one must have a valid institution email address(e.g. xxx.cdut.edu.cn),which
				will get the serial number after submission.

	1.3 Download DENISE codes(e.g. DENISE-Black-Edition-master.zip) from
		https://github.com/daniel-koehn/DENISE-Black-Edition
	   
	1.4 Download DENISE models(e.g. DENISE-Black-Edition-master.zip) from
		https://github.com/daniel-koehn/DENISE-Benchmark
		
2. Installation

	2.1 FFTW
		Use root role
		Decide the installation directory by using flag ' --prefix=/usr/local/fftw ' like that
			$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/fftw
		$ make

		$ make install

		$ vi ~/.bashrc ( Add three lines as below)
			export FFTW_PATH=/usr/local/fftw/bin:$FFTW_PATH
			export FFTW_INC=/usr/local/fftw/include:$FFTW_INC
			export FFTW_LIB=/usr/local/fftw/lib:$FFTW_LIB
		$ source ~/.bashrc
			
	2.2 parallel_studio_xe_2016
		$ tar zxvf parallel_studio_xe_2016.tgz
		$ cd parallel_studio_xe_2016
		$ ./install.sh or ./install_GUI.sh (Using default options)
		$ vi ~/.bashrc ( Add three lines as below)
			source /opt/intel/bin/iccvars.sh intel64
			source /opt/intel/impi/5.1.1.109/bin64/mpivars.sh
			source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
		$ source ~/.bashrc
		$ which mpicc (If everything is ok,then you can see the path as below) 
			/opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.0.109/linux/mpi/intel64/bin/mpicc
	
	2.3 DENISE codes
		Go to the directory you want to put the codes, and upzip the zip file:
			$ unzip DENISE-Black-Edition-master.zip
			
		In the DENISE-Black-Edition-master/libcseife directory simply use the shell script:
			$ make
			
		Links to the include and lib directory of FFTW in the Makefile in DENISE-Black-Edition-master/src directory, e.g.
			SFLAGS=-L./../libcseife -L$//usr/local/fftw/lib
			IFLAGS=-I./../libcseife -I$//usr/local/fftw/include
		
		To compile the main program DENISE in DENISE-Black-Edition-master/src simply type:
			$ make denise
	
	2.4 DENISE models
		Just unzip the DENISE-Black-Edition-master.zip:
			$ unzip DENISE-Black-Edition-master.zip
		
		Copy the model files you wanted to the corresponding directories of DENISE codes
